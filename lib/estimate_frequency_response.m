function [G, C, freq, Pavg] = estimate_frequency_response(inp, out, window, Noverlap, Nest, Ts, delta)
%ESTIMATE_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE  Welch single-sided X/Y spectra with amplitude-calibrated scaling
%   [G, C, freq, Pavg] = estimate_frequency_response(inp, out, window, Noverlap, Nest, Ts, delta)
%
% PURPOSE
%   - Estimate single-sided Welch-averaged spectra Suu, Syu, Syy for real input/output
%   - Return frequency response G = Syu ./ Suu and coherence C consistent with single-sided scaling
%
% INPUTS
%   - inp      [Ndata x 1] real input signal
%   - out      [Ndata x 1] real output signal
%   - window   [Nest x 1] analysis window, e.g. hann(Nest,'periodic')
%   - Noverlap integer overlap in samples, 0..Nest-1
%   - Nest     even integer segment/FFT length, required even in this implementation
%   - Ts       sample time in seconds, Fs = 1/Ts
%   - delta    nonnegative regularization added to Suu to stabilize division, default 0
%
% OUTPUTS
%   - G     frd single-input single-output frequency response estimate over freq [Hz]
%   - C     frd magnitude-squared coherence over freq [Hz]
%   - freq  [Npos x 1] frequency in Hz from 0 to Fs/2 inclusive, Npos = Nest/2 + 1
%   - Pavg  [Npos x 3] single-sided power spectra columns [Suu, Syu, Syy] averaged over segments
%
% SCALING
%   - Internal normalization divides by sum(window)/2 which pre-doubles all bins
%   - DC and Nyquist must not be doubled, so those two bins are divided by 4 in power for all spectra
%   - Interior bins remain doubled, giving correct single-sided scaling; common factors cancel in G and C
%
% METHOD
%   1) Remove global mean from inp and out
%   2) Segment with length Nest and overlap Noverlap, apply window
%   3) FFT each segment of inp and out, normalize by sum(window)/2
%   4) Form two-sided Suu, Syu, Syy, convert to one-sided and fix DC & Nyquist by dividing by 4
%   5) Average over segments to get Pavg, compute G and C, return frd with Units 'Hz'
%
% NOTES
%   - Assumes even Nest and real signals
%   - 50â€“90% overlap and a tapered window give smoother estimates
%   - Per-segment mean removal further suppresses drift but attenuates true DC
%   - delta prevents division by zero in low-excitation bands and does not affect coherence scaling
